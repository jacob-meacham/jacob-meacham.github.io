One sound that you almost never hear anymore is the ticking of a clock. Sure, your parents or grandparents might have an old grandfather clock that still keeps the time, or even a pocket watch (as my grandfather has), but nearly all timekeeping devices these days are in our phones, or at the very least on a digital watch.

Still, there’s something soothing about the sound of a ticking clock, and also something universal in seeing the hands wind around its face, both inexorably marking time’s passage and also demonstrating the fundamental cycles by which we live our lives. Since we don’t need clocks to tell time anymore, there’s lots of fun things that we can do with them!

This project was inspired by those banks of clocks that really important businesses had in the 80s. You know the ones - they’d show the time of New York, London, Tokyo, and would be watching over scurrying office workers in power suits. We wanted a bank of clocks like that, but since we no longer cared what time it was, we decided to mod podge the faces and numbers away.

We love mod podge - its a really simple way to add really great design elements to basically any surface. The first thing to do was to find a bunch of neat pictures that would fit well as small circles to replace the numerals on the clocks.

We decided to make our clocks pretty abstract, so that we could look at them and say, “Oh look, it’s half past snowman o’clock!” You could just pick out some nice looking numbers to use instead. Since we had five clocks (from various thrift shops), we also decided to do a color scheme, so we searched for 60 symbols - 12 each in green, blue, orange, and purple.

For my first clock, I cut the symbols a little too big and ended up with only 8 around the face. Luckily, it doesn’t matter too much and the larger icons are nice.

We first mod podged the entire face of the clocks in their chosen color.

We’ve hung the clock on a few different walls, and in a few different configurations, but what we like best is a circle of clocks. Their batteries have slowly run down and, one by one, they’ve stopped ticking. We haven’t bothered to replace them, because they’re still fun even when they don’t tell the time.
