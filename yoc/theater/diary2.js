    text: `There was a great interview with Paula in the newspaper today - she even quoted me! Like most things, she'd kept quiet about it; I don't think she wants anyone else worrying about our budget. I didn't even know the story was going to run until two days ago. I also didn't know how much experience Paula had on Broadway. I knew that she had been an actress for a long time, but she never told me about all of her roles - the witch in Into the Woods? Reno in Anything Goes? I haven't decided if I'm going to clip out and save the article, but it does make me hope that we get to do our second show.`

    text: `I decided to hang the article on the fridge, at least for now, and I highlighted my quote, which I still think is rather good. "Being part of our city's culture is great, but being among friends every week is what keeps me coming back."

Asher came over tonight and said he hadn't read the article, but agreed with me that it'd be great for us to make up our budget, if only for Paula's sake. I don't think he really likes watching me perform, and he's never come out with us after rehearsal, but he does come to the shows and that's good enough for me.`

    text: `I take back what I said about "friends are what keep me coming back." If I could snap my fingers and create a theater without Vickys, I would do it in a second. Truth be told, I'm really glad I'm not Eliza, but the amount she lords it over me gets on my nerves. I had to write down something she said during rehearsal today, so that I'd be able to quote it verbatim later: "Mrs. Pearce, you really do look quite lovely. Be a dear and fetch me up a snack." We were backstage and she was attempting to stay "in-character," which mostly means ordering me around in a terrible accent. Ugh!

She's always starry-eyed around John. He's not really to my taste (I like men with more hair, and who are a bit taller), and anyway I have Asher now, but I will admit to taking a little bit of joy in flirting with him around her. Tonight during happy hour, I sat next to him and we came up with a prank on Connor where we asked him to sing one of the Freddie songs from "My Fair Lady", and then convinced him that he was way out-of-tune on one note and had him hold it while moving our hands up and down to indicate the proper pitch. Vicky doesn't like John's pranks anyways - and I don't sometimes either, because they can get mean especially against Megan - but she REALLY didn't like it when he and I worked together. I'll have to remember that in the future.`

    text: `There's something that's been bugging me about our weekly happy hours. Not everyone is invited, and I've been having a tough time figuring out how to deal with it. I know that there is always a schism between the techs and the actors, and it definitely doesn't help that John dislikes Meghan, or that Connor sort of goes along with whatever John says.. It's not that they're disinvited, it's just that they never happen to be around when we're all leaving. It's the same with Rich - he's a lot older than most of us (and does a great job as Pickering because of that - quite stuffy!), but somehow he never comes out. It's not just techies vs actors either because David almost always comes out. Maybe it's because he teaches high school and so seems younger? Anyway, I really like chatting with Jess backstage, and we're getting to be pretty friendly so I'd love to have her come out with us.

I just looked back through my past two weeks of entries and it's almost all about the show. Well, the show and Asher. I guess nothing interesting has been going on at work. It's boring, like usual, and I don't really have the opportunity to talk with anyone else, like usual. My boss did call me into his office a few days ago and told me to keep up the good work, but I guess I find the play a lot more interesting, Vicky and all.`

    text: `Today was a mess. There was loud construction during the entire rehearsal. Paula kept getting distracted when giving notes, or would let scenes just go on and on. Shelley showed up and watched for a bit, then talked with Paula backstage and left, looking annoyed. I can always tell when she's annoyed, because she smiles a lot and pats her hair down so that the curls get kind of messy and flat. I don't know what it was about, but I'm betting that she won't be making up the funding shortfall. To top it all off, David told us that the high school wouldn't match funds with us, even if we moved the second weekend to the high school theater. When Asher came over, I was in a pretty bad mood and we got into a little fight about what we should watch on TV. The sex afterwards was pretty good, but he didn't stay over and so here I am, writing about a stupid part in a stupid play, remembering Vicky trying to say "If I was doing it proper, what was you laughing at?" with a jackhammer in the background at 1am.`

    text: `I took the article down from the fridge. Why should I care anyway? It's a little community theater in a little town. The arts budget is cut, but can I honestly say that our show is worth it? I'll finish my time as Mrs. Pearce and move on. I'm not going to write about this at all next week.`

    text: `Work was really boring today. I took a bunch of calls and got yelled at repeatedly over the phone. I liked it better when I used to sit next to Mark. At least then when we were getting yelled at, we could make faces to each other and hand-puppet what the customers were saying. Now that Mark got fired and we're all in separate cubicles, it makes it hard to get to know anyone.`

    text: `OK, I said I wasn't going to write about the play, but there was some drama today, and rereading my entry on Monday put me to sleep. Vicky and Connor just don't have good chemistry together. Neither of them are really that bad (well, Vicky...), but on stage it's painful to watch them. Sometimes, Paula has me read lines with Connor so that she can spend some time with Vicky, and I get the feeling that she'd switch me in for Eliza if she could. Anyway, she got fed up with a scene in the parlor and changed it so that now it's two half monologues. It's still awkward, but I thought it went better than when they were speaking. I don't think Vicky thought so, because she excused herself for a while, and also didn't come with us to happy hour.

Because Vicky didn't come out to the bar, instead of tweaking her nose with John, I ended up spending the time talking with Connor and Paula about theater. They both said that the important thing was that we were all building something together, and that the relationships were driven by that, rather than the other way around.

    text: `I think they're wrong about theater. The play is meaningless. Maybe Paula was on Broadway, but for the rest of us, the only people who are going to come see the show are weird people like Donna, the lady who runs refreshments, or people who are only coming to show support, like Asher. Paula even sort of said that the reason she made Vicky Eliza instead of me was because the play was so important to her. I would have done a great job as Eliza, but being Mrs. Pearce is fine because I can spend time at rehearsal twice a week.`

    text: `We weren't running scenes with me or Pickering today, so Rich and I talked backstage.. He told me that his company was going to up their donation to help us make up the shortfall. I thought it was really nice, especially since he doesn't really hang around with the rest of us. Later, though, John joked that Rich makes a really good Colonel Pickering, going on about his money, and did a parody of him, stuffy English accent and all. I'm not sure about John sometimes. He can be really nice, and I look forward to seeing him every week, but...

Tomorrow we're performing a scene at the library to drum up support for the show. Wish me luck!`

    text: `Wow.
That sucked.
I totally flubbed my scene at the library. I kind of laughed it off - after all, there were only a few people there (Donna included, of course), and it's not like library patrons are known to be wealthy. Maybe I was too flippant, because we mostly packed up in silence, but eventually Vicky slammed down the box she was carrying and said, with tears in her eyes I might add, something about how I need to take this all more seriously. She really gets on my nerves. If what she's doing is taking it seriously, then I definitely don't want to be that. I wish John didn't like her, because it'd be great to see his pranks turned against her.

    text: `Asher and I got in another fight today. He asked why I keep doing community theater when all I seem to do is complain about it to him. I told him that I liked the friendships I'd made, and that I'd even said so in the article I'd hung on the fridge, except I'd forgotten that I'd taken it down. He responded that it didn't really seem like I had made many friends, and that I complained about pretty much everyone there. I said something pretty mean that I don't want to write down, and he left. Now I have to eat this whole pizza by myself.`

    text: `I called Rich today, and asked him what he thought about what had happened on Sunday, and what happened after I left. He pretty much said that he agreed with Vicky. He liked talking with me, but he didn't feel like I wanted to be part of what everyone else was there to work on. He said that after I left, nobody really said anything and John spent some time alone with Vicky to comfort her.`

    text: `We actually got some pretty great news today! Donna works at a bakery, I guess (I never really thought about where the concession stand's baked goods came from), and she said that they'd be willing to make up the donation shortfall if we printed their name in the playbill and credited them as a major sponsor on any more flyers we were going to put up. Everyone was really excited and Paula kept giving us hugs. It's not totally clear that we'll be able to do our second performance, but it seems a lot more likely now.

I decided to invite both Jess and Donna to happy hour. Donna as thanks for what she did, and Jess because I like her more than anyone else right now and I think she should share in the happiness of what happened.

Oh! And one other little thing. When I was coming out of the bathroom, I happened to glance out into the parking lot and saw John and Vicky making out next to his car. Scandalous!`

    text: `I accidentally told Rich and Connor that I saw John and Vicky making out. Connor was incensed - his and Vicky's chemistry is already terrible, and he felt like this would make it even worse. I'm not sure if this is why, but Vicky's new monologue went extremely poorly. Her accent kept slipping between proper and Cockney, and Paula kept trying to give her notes, but she'd sort of listen and nod really tightly and then say "Ok, Ok, I got it, let's go again" more and more shrilly. I eventually left but Paula and Vicky were still going at it. Asher took me out to dinner tonight, the first time I'd seen him since Monday when we fought. We didn't talk about the play at all, even though I wanted to. I wanted to tell him that I do so have friends there, in fact I invited them to happy hour and chatted with them all evening. We ended up having sex at his place, but I decided to come back home since I have to do another community scene tomorrow at the farmer's market.`

    text: `The farmer's market scene went much better than the one last Sunday. Paula kind of hinted that maybe we should do a different scene (one I wasn't in), but I told her that this is the scene we practiced and it's the one we should do. The crowd seemed to enjoy it, and Vicky's performance was much less wooden than it is normally. I told her so (in a nice way, I promise!) and she looked sort of surprised. I do think she can be good at what she does, she just takes it so seriously.`

    text: `Today was the first rehearsal in the performance space. David had been working all weekend on a piece of the set that was supposed to be double-sided so that it could be turned between the outdoors and the parlor. The mechanics seemed to work pretty well, but it really looked pretty awful.

Jess and I stayed behind to help him repaint the stupid thing. I'm not much of an artist, but Jess seems to be and I can follow instructions well enough. I didn't know this, but she takes care of her disabled sister during the day. She told me a couple of stories about what she and her sister used to do that were hilarious.`

    text: `I thought the run-through yesterday was bad, but the one today was so much worse. No one could get the blocking right in the new space. We kept running into each other, or being in the wrong place, or forgetting our lines. It's been weeks since we haven't been able to make it through scenes more-or-less intact, but I'm not sure we ran a single full scene tonight.

Paula gave a really weird pep talk about how, sometimes people fail and that's ok, but we shouldn't be those people and besides, our whole community was counting on us for this play. All I could think about the whole time was how often she kept clearing her throat and drumming her fingers on her coffee cup. Anyway, her speech was too grandiose and a bit demotivating, but in a weird way helped, I think? At least, everyone seemed a bit happier afterwards, myself included. I'm not too sure why - maybe it was just the fact that we all sat there together and listened to her for 20 minutes.`

    text: `Meghan had to run home today in the middle of the first tech rehearsal. I think John said something to her, and she and Jess were up in the rigging doing lights. I think she broke down a little bit, because Jess had to help her down to the ground.`

    text: `Gah! We did a TV spot on the local news about the play tomorrow. They filmed a bit of our rehearsal (more on that later) and did some interviews with each of us. I don't know if my interview aired, and I never will because I asked Asher to tape it but he didn't.

The dress rehearsal was a mess. The lighting still wasn't done and we're having all sorts of technical difficulties. My microphone kept cutting out, so we had to redo a scene three different times while I waited for Jess to work the issues out. At the very beginning, we couldn't even get the curtain to open. I'm not usually too superstitious, but that's a bad omen if ever there was one. Even with all the issues though, Vicky and I actually had a lot of fun together tonight. Our scenes went really well and while we were waiting for our interview slots with the TV crew, she told me about how she always got nervous and excited the day before opening night, but on opening night she feels a weird sense of calm. Maybe I can channel that tomorrow, as well.`
