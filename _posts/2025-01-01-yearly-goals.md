Every year, I take the time to reflect on the previous year and set goals for the coming year!

# 2024 Year In Review
*Related post: [goals for 2024]({% post_url 2024-01-01-yearly-goals %})*

This year, we welcomed our second daughter, Carmen, into our family. I chose to set monthly goals for the year, since babies in their first year of life tend to need a lot. It turns out this was both a great idea and got derailed halfway through the year, as you'll see below.

<span class="goal-green">January — Write code</span>

I set a goal of writing code 10/31 days in January. I started a [NES emulator](https://github.com/jacob-meacham/pixelnes), worked through part of an [old advent of code](https://github.com/jacob-meacham/advent-of-code/tree/main/2019), wrote an [interpreter](https://github.com/jacob-meacham/lox), and did a few [cryptopals exercises](https://github.com/jacob-meacham/cryptopals)

<span class="goal-green">February — Watch 13 movies</span>

I watched:
* Across the Spiderverse
* Into the Spiderverse (rewatched)
* Apollo 13 (rewatched)
* How to Train your Dragon
* Happy Feet
* Glengarry Glenn Ross
* Suzume (すずめの戸締まり)
* My Neighbor Totoro (rewatched)
* Paris is Burning
* House of Games
* Enron: Smartest Guys in the Room
* Moneyball
* The Last Unicorn

<span class="goal-green">March — Setup home lab</span>

I set up a home lab in the basement, including a remote gaming rig. I also designed and fabricated a PCB to allow my smart home control of dumb IR devices

<span class="goal-green">April — Bike 2x/week</span>

Lots of Zwift!

<span class="goal-yellow">May — Write 3 blog post</span>

I only ended up writing one

<span class="goal-yellow">June — Read 2 books</span>

I read only one — [The Narrow Road Between Desires](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/157265081-the-narrow-road-between-desires)

<span class="goal-green">July — Take 4 Japanese lessons</span>

はい、終わりました！

<span class="goal-yellow">August — Take advantage of Montana outdoors</span>

This was going very well - in fact I was taking a quick mountain bike ride after work when...

It turns out the ground is a lot harder than my shoulder and the tuberosity of my humerus was ripped off (an avulsion fraction). This put a damper on August, and I also took off <span class="goal-red">September</span> to heal.

<span class="goal-green">October — Do the NYT crossword every day</span>

Complete!

<span class="goal-green">November — Spend as little as possible</span>

We used this as a good reset. Doing free activities, not eating out, using more of the groceries in our pantry, and not ordering random stuff on Amazon. This was helpful and so far has led to an overall change in our habits

<span class="goal-green">December — Do 3 woodworking projects</span>

I made a number of Christmas presents!
