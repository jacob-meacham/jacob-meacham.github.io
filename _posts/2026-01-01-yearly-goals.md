Every year, I take the time to reflect on the previous year and set goals for the coming year.

# 2025 Year In Review
*Related post: [goals for 2025]({% post_url 2025-01-01-yearly-goals %})*

Whew, 2025 really got away from me! It was a great year in many ways, but I had more success on the professional and family side than for my personal goals

<span class="goal-red">1. Do more outdoors</span> If anything, I spent less time outside in 2025

<span class="goal-yellow">Stay on top of streaks</span> My best streak was walking 2 miles (54.2% of days). Others were 33%, 18%, and lower.

<span class="goal-red">3. Add more rituals</span> I didn't add any additional rituals, though some interesting ones are shaping up for 2026!

<span class="goal-red">4. Set and achieve a monthly goal</span> Not only did I not accomplish any, I didn't set any!


# 2026 Personal Goals

I like to explore different formats for my personal goals. In previous years I've used OKR-style categories and monthly goals. This year, I am creating empty buckets with a capacity I want to fill by the end of the year, instead of more specific goals. These buckets are:
* things I want to do *consistently*,
* things I want to *create*, and
* one-time milestones I want to *achieve*. 

## I. Habits

I've been tracking daily and weekly streaks for a while now, and will try to keep these streaks going more consistently.

| Habit | Frequency |
|-------|-----------|
| Cycle/Climb/Ski | 2x/week |
| Walk 2 Miles | Daily |
| Flexibility Tiny Task | Daily |
| Drink 32 oz water | Daily |
| Read 20 minutes | Daily |
| Learn a Langauge 15 minutes | Daily |
| 2 Pomodors | Daily |
| Tidy Up | Daily |
| Sleep 8 hours | Daily |
| Mindful time with family | Daily |
| Make Dinner | 1x/week |
| Go Outdoors | 1x/week |

## II. Creations

Complete 5 creations. These are tangible artifacts that I can point at in December; a thing that exists because I made it.

Some examples that would sit in this bucket:
* **6 blog posts**
* **A poetry chapbook**
* **Record 6 songs**
* **A woodworking project**
* **An electronics project**
* **A coding project**
* **A home improvement project**

## III. Milestones

Achieve 5 milestones. These are achievements, experiences, or moments that happen once and that I'd look back on as real wins.

Some examples that would sit in this bucket:
* **Climb a V6 again**
* **Play on stage**
* **Complete 15 outdoor adventures**
* **Host 5 musical jam sessions**
* **Complete a D&D game**
* **Get LASIK**
