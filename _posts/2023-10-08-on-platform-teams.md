    On what a platform team is

Platform Team - Be obsessed with your internal customer 

There is an adage in the product world or any business that states, “Always treat your customers as royals”. The same lesson applies to how internal customers should be treated. Just because the internal customers are forced to use internal services does not mean they should not be treated like an external customer.   

 

If there has been a breach of SLA, a data corruption, or missing data, it's important to share this information as early and as clearly as possible with stakeholders and the user base. This ensures that we keep their trust and demonstrate that we believe their data is important to us and we will do our best to recover any data lost. 

 

You are the expert in the platform, but your users are the experts in actually using the platform. Listen to them! 

 

Much like any other product, talk with your users, understand what they want. You have a leg up because you’re working with others at the company 

 

Be service-obsessed 

 

You may have more KTLO work than a non-platform team. Watch this carefully, optimize it when necessary 

 

Maturity model, leverage, and scaling 

Platform team does everything and takes input from stakeholders 

Platform team does some things, for things stakeholders want that the team will not get to the stakeholders can contribute code and the platform team will review in a timely manner. 

Platform team creates the conditions so others can be reviewers like (2) above. 

 

Tools to use 

Interviews with stakeholders 

Try it out yourself / embed with your users. Eg do CX calls 

Surveys 

Collect metrics just like we would with a product 

 

Don’t push water uphill. People will rush to do something that is awesome 

 

Think about how you do your communication. If people don’t understand what you’ve built, they won’t use it 

 

Use squad reviews to your advantage 

 

Assuming that usability of infrastructure isn’t important because their users are engineers. This isn’t true: even engineers obey the laws of distraction, typos and time. Worse, it’s more common for internal users to churn off a platform because of usability than because of legitimate feature gaps (how many times have you been told that it “actually, is possible” to do X task on Y platform, and then heard a complicated work around?), so lack of investment here tends to cause significant–and in my opinion often mistaken–pressure to build new platforms. 

Accepting the current status quo as good enough, and languishing with a decent system instead of continuing to push towards something phenomenal.
