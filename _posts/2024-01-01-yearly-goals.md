## Future Me Will Thank Me
* <span class="goal-yellow">Write for at least 30 minutes, once a week</span> — I didn't write as consistently as desired, but I did end up writing 8 blog posts this year that I'm pretty happy with
* <span class="goal-red">Become intermediate in Japanese</span> — I didn't get back to Japanese, beyond a smattering of [Wanikani](wanikani.com) and Duolingo reviews
* <span class="goal-red">Create more!</span>
	* <span class="goal-red">Work through at least one classic coding exercise</span>
    - <span class="goal-green">Finish an Advent of Code challenge</span>
    - <span class="goal-red">Build at least 2 physical objects</span> 
* <span class="goal-yellow">Find flow twice a week</span> — I built more space into my system for getting things done, but I did not fully achieve as much flow as I would have liked

## Work/Life Integration

* <span class="goal-yellow">Mindbody engineering is firing on all cylinders</span>
    - <span class="goal-yellow">Spend a reasonable amount of time working</span> - Not totally sustainable, but in a better place than at the beginning of the year
    - <span class="goal-green">Ensure the team is performing well (based on my performance review)</span>

## Consumption

* <span class="goal-red">Clean out reading backlog</span> — I read much less than I hoped to this year, though as a consequence, the backlog also didn't grow.
* <span class="goal-green">Watch 12 great movies</span>
    - 2001: A Space Odyssey
    - Knives Out (arguable as a great movie; I liked some of Rian Johnson's earlier work - like Brick - better)
    - The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent
    - The Wizard of Oz (rewatch)
    - Spirited Away (rewatch)
    - Network
    - Sideways (rewatch)
    - The Pajama Game
    - Honey, I Shrunk the Kids (rewatch)
    - Dune: Part One
    - Inside Out (rewatch)
    - LOTR: The Two Towers (rewatch)
* <span class="goal-yellow">Read 5 classic books</span>
    - The Hobbit, The Fellowship of the Rings, The Two Towers

## Physical

* <span class="goal-red">Take 10 swim lessons</span>
* <span class="goal-red">Complete a mountain bike race</span> — No, but I did mountain bike a ton
* <span class="goal-green">Maintain blood pressure below 130/80</span> - 127/74
* <span class="goal-yellow">Achieve great joint health</span> — I didn't do the prescribed, but I did have less joint pain in other ways

## Home

* <span class="goal-green">Complete 1 major house project</span> — Ran network wiring and completed a bathroom remodel
* <span class="goal-green">Transform the shop into a space of pride</span> — The shop is much more functional than it has ever been. It's not yet show-off worthy, but is now usable as a shop
* <span class="goal-green">Cook twice a week</span> — I generally took a dedicated meal every week and then also took another 1-2 meals during the week ad hoc. This was a great experience this year!

# 2024 Personal Goals
In February, I'm welcoming my second daughter into the world. I don't know how having a second child will affect my free time, so setting year-long goals feels a bit ambitious. Instead, this year I'll be trying to set and accomplish smaller monthly goals.
