title: 2023 Personal Goals / 2022 In Review
layout: post

Every year, I reflect on my previous year and what I'd like to accomplish in the next year. The format has changed over time; for 2023 these are OKR-ish, broken into a couple of categories

# Future me will thank me

These are goals that compound; not all of them necessarily compound into something immediately practical, but all of them turn into skills I want to learn or keep up with

* **Write for at least 30 minutes, 1x / week** I have previously found a lot of joy in writing but my skills have atrophied enough that I find it more frustrating than joyous. I need to do the exercise of writing to find flow again.
* **Become intermediate in Japanese** I can carry on a basic but useful conversation in Japanese but haven't yet been able to reach the intermediate plateau.
    - Do 26 italki sessions
* **Create more!** Creation, whether phsyical or conceptual, is  is my underlying heartbeat.
    - Work through at least one classic coding exercise:
        + Spreadsheet
        + Ray Tracer
        + Game emulator
    - Finish an Advent of Code
    - Build at least 2 physical objects
* **Find flow 2x/week** As an executive, I tend to most often be in context switching mode and don't find a state of flow as often as I'd like. I want to create intentional space for finding flow. I've attempted

# Work/Life Integration

Late last year, I took on a much larger role leading the global engineering team at Mindbody. Given where we are vs. where we need to be, I'm currently spending more time on the work side of the line. That, along with family, means that there are other hobbies I'm not currently spending time on. The goal this year is to return the time commitment at work to something that allows for more capacity against other hobbies.

* **Mindbody engineering is firing on all cylinders**
    - Sane amount of time spent working
    - The team is performing well (based on my perf review)

# Consumption

My goal in general has been to consume less and create more - and to be conscious of the quality of the work I do consume. Even before taking into account the effects of generative AI, media is effectively infinite and given that there isn't a ton of shared context anymore, consuming new media doesn't confer much advantage.

* **Clean out reading backlog** I have hundreds of saved tabs to read; I'd like to burn this backlog down in one way or another
* **Watch 12 great movies**
* **Read 5 classic books**

# Physical

* **Take 10 swim lessons** I live in a city with a lot of rivers and do some river surfing - my clear limiting factor is my ability to swim.
* **Complete a mountain bike race** My most consistent sport over the last few years
* **<130/<80 average blood pressure** My blood pressure hasn't been great the last few years, so I'd like to bring it back to something sustainable
* **Great joint health** (<5 days in Q4 that my joints hurt)
    - Do 20 Pilates sessions
    - Yoga 1x/week

# Home

* **Complete 1 big house project**
* **The shop is a space of pride** Last year, the shop was semi-unusable. It's now quite functional but not yet a space that I love to spend time in. I'd like to change that this year.
* **Cook 2x/week** I like the ritual of nourishing my family and am looking to do it more often. I recently started doing sous vide, which also scratches an engineering itch
