# IN DRAFT

My family loves seltzer and cold brew coffee. We used to use a sodastream, but it seemed wasteful and expensive, and we were always running out. There are many keezer builds on the intenet (and you can also buy commercial versions) that put the taps directly on the keezer, but I couldn't find as many instructions for building a home remote draw system. Our new house has a basement with space right below the kitchen, allowing for this possibility.

# Parts List

* Insulated Line
* Freezer
* Temperature Controller
* Timer
* Glycol
* Glycol Pump
* CO2 regulator
* Nitro regulator
* Secondary regulator
* Manifold
* Manifold
* Kegs
* Ball Couplers
* Insulation
* Wood
* 3/16" inner diameter line
* Nitro tap
* Taps
* Tower
* Cooling Line
* Quick Couplers

# Build
Elected to build higher so that could fit more kegs in

# Limitations
* Manifold and separate regulator only on CO2, not on the nitrogen as well. I figured I'd use the CO2 more, but it turns out that pushing liquid with an inert gas is really useful for cocktails, lemonade, tea, and other stuff you don't want to carbonate
* The glycol is only cooled to the temperature of the freezer

# Future
* Manifold on the nitrogen
* Separate glycol chiller
* Carbonator and Plumbing
