I presented on the main stage at Big Sky Dev Con 2018, about my experience building a simple Serverless backend at [Doppler Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_Labs). It was a fun experience building a use case from scratch for the presentation, but I also discovered that I'm not that energized by presenting at conferences. You can [see the code on Github](https://github.com/jacob-meacham/bsdc-2018-serverless) and [find the slides here](https://www.slideshare.net/JacobMeacham/bsdc-2018-serverless-presentation).
