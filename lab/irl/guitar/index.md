This was my first major woodworking project. The soundboard is sitka spruce, and the back and sides are indian rosewood. The bracing is a combination of spruce and mahogany. The endgraft, centerline on the back, fretboard, and body bindings are all ebony, and the purfling (the black and white strips on the top and sides) are maple. The neck is a single block of mahogany, with a dark indian rosewood binding the sides of the fretboard. The headstock is a combination of rosewood from the back and ebony.
