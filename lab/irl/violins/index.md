This is a work-in-progress view on a set of matching violins. The body and sides are all from a single piece of flamed, locally sourced maple. The neck is a figured European maple, and the various blocks, lining, and bass bar are all hand split spruce from Colorado. Violins don't usually have an end graft, but I really like them, so both of these have an ebony end-graft.
