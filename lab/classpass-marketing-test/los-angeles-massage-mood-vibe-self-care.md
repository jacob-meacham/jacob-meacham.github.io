# When you need to treat yourself: massage for self care in Los Angeles

Self care isn't selfish — it's maintenance. And sometimes the best thing you can do for yourself is lie down, let someone work out the knots, and remember what it feels like to not carry everything at once. LA's massage community has found the studios that turn an appointment into a genuine escape: places where you walk out feeling lighter, looser, and a little more like yourself.

## Why massage helps with self care

Massage gives your body permission to stop holding on. The physical release of tension often comes with a mental one — members consistently describe leaving their favorite sessions not just physically restored, but emotionally reset. In a city that never stops moving, the right massage is an hour of radical stillness.

## Studios our community loves for this

### SPENCER'S

SPENCER'S has created the kind of experience that members describe as a hotel staycation compressed into a single appointment. From the calm, luxurious lounge to the skilled therapists who share stretches and recovery tips after each session, every detail is designed to make you feel genuinely cared for.

> "Gabriel was an absolute, heaven-sent angel. Such a soothing demeanor and exemplified strength. From beginning to end, it truly felt like I escaped to a hotel staycation for an hour. I will definitely be back!"

### Great Bodywork and Spa

Great Bodywork and Spa in Hollywood has earned a quietly devoted following for consistently excellent massage — the kind where therapists actually listen, check in on pressure, and target the areas you need most. Members love the post-session tea and the sense that this small studio punches well above its weight.

> "In the heart of Hollywood this place managed to feel like such a sweet escape, a true sanctuary. I left feeling rejuvenated!"

> "I'm usually very picky with massage places, but I have to say — this was honestly one of the best I've ever been to. The studio was super clean, the people were friendly and welcoming, and the massage was amazing."

> "Another amazing massage! They give you a form to fill out desired pressure, problem areas — and they actually do it! They mix elements of Thai and Swedish with the deep tissue where needed. Totally recommend this place."

### Crystal's Healing Arts

This intimate studio offers a holistic healing experience that goes far beyond a standard massage. With jade hot stones, Ayurvedic herbal oils, custom essential oils, gua sha, and cupping, Crystal creates a multi-sensory ritual that members describe as transformative self care at its most intentional.

> "Crystal really offers a whole healing experience — rather than just a no-frills massage — with the atmosphere, sounds, sage, stones, and custom essential oils. I was really impressed by the pressure too! I'll definitely book again."

> "I felt like I was being healed in so many ways and cannot wait to go back. What an amazing self care day!"

> "I got the jade hot stone massage. It was such an incredible, relaxing, grounding experience. The Ayurvedic herbal, warm oils, expert massage, hot jade stones — everything works together to create an unbelievable experience."

### Anna's Holistic Bodywork

Anna's buccal massage and holistic bodywork sessions have built a passionate word-of-mouth following among members seeking something deeper than a typical spa visit. The guided meditation before treatment and the stunning, serene treatment space make every appointment feel like a full reset.

> "What I experienced was so much more than a belly massage — it was a truly holistic, healing experience. She began with a guided meditation that helped me fully relax and drop into my body. I left feeling lighter, more grounded, and deeply nourished."
