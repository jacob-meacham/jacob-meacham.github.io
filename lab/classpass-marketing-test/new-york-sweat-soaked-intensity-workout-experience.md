# Sweat-soaked classes in New York that reviewers refuse to stop booking

Some classes are technically a workout. Then there are the ones that leave you standing in the lobby afterward, shirt soaked, heart still hammering, already thinking about when you can come back. New York has no shortage of places that promise intensity -- but only a handful actually deliver it in a way that has thousands of ClassPass members writing glowing reviews about how drenched they got.

We searched through tens of thousands of reviews across the entire New York ClassPass community specifically looking for the language of real sweat: "drenched," "soaking," "dripping," "heart rate through the roof," "burned more calories." The seven studios below rose to the top because members keep using these exact words -- not just once, but again and again, class after class.

## What separates a genuinely intense class from a tough-sounding one

Intensity on a class description is easy to promise. What reviewers actually respond to is something more specific: classes that get your heart rate elevated and keep it there, programming that doesn't let you coast, and instructors who push you in a way that feels motivating rather than punishing. The studios here earn their sweat-soaked reputation through consistent feedback -- not just one great review, but dozens of members describing the same drenched, breathless, accomplished feeling.

## Studios where New York members leave soaking

### Rumble Boxing

Rumble Boxing's Flatiron/Chelsea location has become the go-to destination for ClassPass members who want a boxing-and-HIIT workout that leaves zero doubt about whether they worked hard.

Across nearly 2,900 reviews and a 4.95 average rating, the words "drenched," "sweat," and "intense" appear in the reviews at a rate few studios in New York can match.
