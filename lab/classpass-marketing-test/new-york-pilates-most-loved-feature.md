# Most loved Pilates in New York

We analyzed thousands of reviews across New York's Pilates scene to find the studios that don't just score well — they inspire genuine devotion. These are the places where members come back class after class, rave in their reviews, and can't stop telling friends. From reformer-focused boutiques to mat classes that feel like a personal training experience, here are the Pilates studios New Yorkers love most.

Studios were ranked by a combination of average rating, review enthusiasm, and consistency of praise from the ClassPass community.

## 1. Project Pilates — Reformer Tower Chair

Project Pilates in Jersey City has built an almost fanatical following, with members praising the studio's hands-on, form-focused teaching style. The small-format classes mean instructors catch every detail, and reviewers say the difference shows in their results.

> "The instructor is hands-on and corrects your form to make sure you are using the right muscles. She is so kind and knowledgeable — the best Pilates instructor I have ever taken a class with."

> "Very informative about all the basic moves and explained why we did them. A great class for building a strong foundation."

**Rating:** 4.87 (500+ reviews)

## 2. SLT — Essentials

SLT's megaformer-based method has earned a devoted community across the city, and the Essentials class is where many members fall in love with the format. Reviewers consistently praise instructors who balance intensity with patience, making the notoriously challenging class accessible to newcomers.

> "The instructor was welcoming and friendly from the front desk to the studio. Despite being my first class and going slower than others, I had a great and fun experience."

> "This class is beginner-friendly but intense. The instructor really pushes you to give your all, but in the best possible way."

**Rating:** 4.80 (471 reviews)

## 3. Mind Your Body — Advanced Beginner Tower/Mat

Tucked away on the Upper East Side, Mind Your Body offers an intimate, personalized Pilates experience that reviewers describe as transformative. With just six reformers per class, the studio delivers the kind of individual attention that larger studios simply can't match.

> "Small studio with only six reformers, and with three people in my class, it was a truly personalized experience. The instructor paid attention to each of us individually — that just doesn't happen in bigger classes."

> "The instructor made me feel so welcomed. This has been my favorite class ever. We were laughing, made connections, and felt our bodies get stronger with each move."

**Rating:** 4.88 (42 reviews)

## 4. Power Pilates — Reformer Tower

Power Pilates Midtown draws a loyal following with its classical approach and expert instructors. Members highlight the clear, precise cueing that makes even complex reformer sequences feel intuitive, whether you're a seasoned practitioner or stepping onto the carriage for the first time.

> "The instructor was amazing — very professional and kind. His instructions were so clear that it made the entire class more enjoyable."

**Rating:** 4.79 (149 reviews)

## 5. Sportset Health and Fitness Club — Mat Pilates

Just outside the city in Rockville Centre, Sportset offers a community-driven mat Pilates program that reviewers keep coming back to. The welcoming atmosphere and consistent quality have earned it a dedicated following among members looking for a grounded, no-frills Pilates experience.
