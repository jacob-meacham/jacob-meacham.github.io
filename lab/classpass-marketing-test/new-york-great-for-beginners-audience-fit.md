# Beginner-friendly studios in New York that reviewers can't stop recommending

Walking into a new studio for the first time can feel like a big leap. Will the class move too fast? Will you know what to do with the equipment? Will everyone else seem like they've been doing this for years? These are normal questions, and you deserve honest answers.

We searched thousands of reviews across the entire New York ClassPass community -- not just the highest-rated studios overall, but specifically the places where people talk about their first-time experiences, beginner-friendliness, and feeling welcomed as newcomers. The seven studios below stood out because real reviewers kept mentioning how supported they felt walking in with zero experience.

## What makes a studio genuinely beginner-friendly

It's not just about offering a "beginner" class on the schedule. The studios that earned the most praise from first-timers share a few things in common: instructors who explain the equipment before class starts, clear verbal cues that make it easy to follow along, thoughtful form corrections delivered with encouragement rather than judgment, and a community atmosphere where nobody makes you feel out of place. That's what the reviews told us, and that's what guided this list.

## Studios where New York beginners feel at home

### Pilates Habitat

With 2,416 reviews and a 4.94 average rating, Pilates Habitat has quietly become one of New York's most trusted spots for people trying reformer Pilates for the first time. Reviewers praise the intimate class sizes (maxing out at six people) and instructors who walk you through every machine and movement before you begin. The result is a class that feels more like a semi-private session than a group experience.

> "It was my first time ever doing Pilates, and the instructor explained everything so clearly that I could easily follow along. We got to use two different machines, which made the class really fun and engaging. The class was well-paced, supportive, and never felt intimidating for a beginner."

> "I've done Pilates a few times but still consider myself a beginner. The instructor was the perfect fit for me -- slowly walked me through steps and demonstrated moves when necessary. She also tailored the movements to my level, making the class challenging but also doable."

**Rating:** 4.94 (2,416 reviews)

### BK Pilates

BK Pilates has earned 2,173 reviews and a 4.91 average rating, with a notable concentration of first-timers raving about how easy it is to follow along. Reviewers who describe themselves as complete beginners highlight the clear instruction, hands-on form corrections, and modifications offered at every level. The studio also offers dedicated beginner and intermediate tiers, so you can progress at your own pace.

> "I'm a beginner and the instructor was easy to understand and follow. The studio is clean and beautiful."

> "Genuinely the best class I've ever taken. I'm still new to Pilates, and the instructor was so hands-on with helping me correct my form and movements. The energy was so warm and infectious -- the class itself was challenging, but in a way that makes me excited to keep doing it."

**Rating:** 4.91 (2,173 reviews)

### Fierce Grace Yoga

Hot yoga can sound intimidating, but Fierce Grace Yoga has built a reputation for making newcomers feel completely at ease. Across 3,045 reviews and a 4.93 average rating, first-timers consistently describe the environment as inviting and the instructors as genuinely encouraging. The studio offers alternatives for beginners throughout class, and reviewers love the thoughtful touches -- like the cold lavender compress handed out at the end.

### Sui Yoga Soho

Sui Yoga Soho is one of the most-reviewed studios in the New York ClassPass community, with 4,676 reviews and a 4.93 average rating. What sets it apart for beginners is the way instructors create a "go at your own pace" atmosphere in every class. Reviewers who were brand new to hot yoga describe feeling comfortable enough to challenge themselves without any pressure, and the studio's calming design -- plus an onsite cafe -- makes the whole experience feel welcoming from the moment you walk in.

> "My first class was great. I was a little intimidated to do a hot yoga class, but the lighting and audio were very calming. The instructor was lovely. I'm coming back regularly."

> "The instructor made me feel comfortable enough to challenge my body while finding balance in my mind. I still consider myself rather new to yoga and have stayed in the comfortable realm of vinyasa classes for fear of not knowing enough. This class changed that."

**Rating:** 4.93 (4,676 reviews)

The megaformer can look like a piece of equipment from another planet, but [solidcore] has a knack for making first-timers feel right at home.

Instructors give physical adjustments with permission, offer modifications, and keep the energy motivating without being overwhelming.

Across 1,179 reviews and a 4.91 average rating, the word "welcoming" appears again and again from people who had never touched a reformer before walking through the door. Their dedicated beginner foundations class and small class sizes mean instructors have the time to show you every part of the machine before you start moving.

> "I have been wanting to try reformer but was intimidated by the equipment. The beginner-friendly class was a great experience with accessible pacing and clear instruction."

> "It was my first time ever taking a reformer Pilates class and the instructor was so sweet and welcoming. She showed me all the parts of the reformer and had me do a few moves to get comfortable before class started. During class, she was clear in her instructions and made sure I was in correct form."
