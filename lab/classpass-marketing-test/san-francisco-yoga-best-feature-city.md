# The best yoga studios in San Francisco

San Francisco's yoga scene is as diverse as the city itself. Whether you are chasing the burn of a 75-minute power flow or melting into a yin session with hot stones, these studios deliver world-class instruction, passionate communities, and spaces that keep members coming back week after week. We crunched the ratings and reviews from the ClassPass community to bring you the seven studios that truly stand out.

Studios were selected based on review volume, average rating, and consistency of positive feedback from the ClassPass community.

## 1. Karma Yoga SF

Karma Yoga SF earns its name. With an extended 75-minute format for both its power and yin offerings, the studio gives practitioners the rare gift of time -- time to settle in, build heat, and fully unwind. The power flow carries a 4.90 average across more than 500 reviews, while the essential-oil-infused yin sessions hold steady at 4.82.

> "Literally my favorite workout class ever. Over Barry's, Soul, any yoga, and any Pilates. And only with Taylor. Look forward to it every week!"

## 2. Divine Yoga Studio

Divine Yoga Studio punches well above its intimate footprint. The cozy, smaller space creates a warm atmosphere where alignment cues land and instructors know every student by name. The vinyasa flow draws experienced practitioners with its multi-level approach, while the gentle flow class is a neighborhood favorite for beginners looking to build a breath-centered practice.

> "Thank you, Karen, for the lovely and well-balanced class! I found the alignment cues throughout to be incredibly helpful. The space is cozy and on the smaller side, which creates a warm and intimate atmosphere."

> "This studio is small but so intimate and adorable! I really love the vibe and they offer amazing meditative experiences on Friday, Saturdays, and Sunday which is rare for this neighborhood."

> "Excellent flow, intense and sweaty but also deeply centering and soothing. Phillip is a lovely person and I hope to take more classes with him!"

## 3. Yoga Flow SF -- Noe

Yoga Flow SF in Noe Valley has built one of the most loyal followings in the city. The studio is known for instructors who teach with uncommon depth -- holding poses longer than most, singing during savasana, and encouraging students to push past their comfort zones. The Flow and Restore class blends active movement with a restorative cool-down that members describe as the perfect balance.

> "Brad is an incredible teacher. Although the pace and general structure is the same, no two classes by him are the same, there's always new flows and poses to try. He teaches using multi-level instruction so anyone can feel comfortable and challenged in class."

> "I really enjoyed Moonsun's instructions and style of flow. She really makes you focus on your pose and we hold it for much longer than a lot of teachers. Your body really gets to feel the pose in depth."
