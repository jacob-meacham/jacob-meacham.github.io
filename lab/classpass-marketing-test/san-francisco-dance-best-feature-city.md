San Francisco's dance scene pulses with energy, from Bollywood beats in the East Bay to ballet barre work in Oakland and free-form movement in Marin. Whether you are a seasoned performer or stepping onto the floor for the very first time, the Bay Area has a studio that will make you fall in love with dance. We combed through thousands of ClassPass member ratings and reviews to bring you the seven best dance studios in San Francisco and the surrounding metro area.

Studios were selected based on review volume, average rating, and consistency of positive feedback from the ClassPass community.

## 1. Blackbox Studios -- Adult Pointe

Blackbox Studios in Oakland has earned a perfect 5.0 rating -- and once you take a class, it is easy to see why. Specializing in ballet for adults of every level, Blackbox offers pointe, beginner ballet, and intermediate/advanced classes in a clean, intimate studio space. The teaching style is rigorous yet nurturing, meeting every student exactly where they are and pushing them to grow.

> "Theresa's incredibly nurturing and masterful teaching is literally changing my life. Within a week of starting ballet again after 35 years, I was dancing on pointe. I have never danced at this level before and I'm in my 50s."

**Rating:** 5.0 (44 reviews)

## 2. Open Floor Dance (Sausalito) -- Open Floor Weekend Dance

Open Floor Dance brings a completely different energy to the Bay Area dance landscape. There are no choreographed steps to memorize here. Instead, a teacher plays arrival music, offers awareness principles, and then lets you move freely to a long, uninterrupted set. It is part meditation, part dance party, and part community ritual.

> "Ditch your inner Grace and twirl amongst your fellow Frankies. Had the vibes of a holistic daytime rave where you can twirl, stretch, and interact at your own pace."

**Rating:** 4.98 (97 reviews)

## 3. Sun Bollywood -- Bolly N Fit

If you want a high-energy cardio workout disguised as a dance party, Sun Bollywood is it. Bolly N Fit sessions blend Bollywood, hip-hop, K-pop, and Tollywood music into an exhilarating, sweat-drenching hour. The moves are broken down so beginners can follow along, but the intensity will challenge even seasoned dancers.

> "Raunak just keeps the intensity high and steps easy to follow. I am completely drained out but smiling as the high of Bollywood songs gets us all going. I'll come back, and bring a friend too!"

> "Excellent class! Raunak brings a lot of energy and unending enthusiasm. Music is a mix of Bollywood, hip hop, Tollywood but is high intensity and lots of fun."

**Rating:** 4.83 (75 reviews)
