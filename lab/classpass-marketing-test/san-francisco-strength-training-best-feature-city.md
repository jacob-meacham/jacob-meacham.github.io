## 1. BootCampSF

There is something special about grinding through a strength and endurance circuit in the middle of Golden Gate Park. BootCampSF holds its outdoor sessions at Robin Williams Meadows, combining high-intensity strength work with the energy of training in one of the most iconic parks in the country. Rain or shine, the instructors show up and adapt.

> "Lauren was great! Running is not good for my lower back and she suggested a perfect modification -- walking with 2-15 lb dumbbells. I still benefited from it. Loved her full body session. It was challenging but not crazy that one couldn't complete each part. It was raining this morning so I was glad to hear class is not canceled. We just practiced our workout by the Academy of Science's front door which is covered area."

> "Friendly, upbeat encouraging instructor, adeptly adapted stations for varying abilities. Great class."

**Rating:** 4.98 (54 reviews)

## 2. Proaction Athletics Boot Camp

With over 500 reviews and a near-perfect score, Proaction Athletics is the most-reviewed strength training studio on this list for a reason. Instructor Shon is legendary among ClassPass members for her attention to form, infectious energy, and ability to create workouts that are both unique and brutally effective. Small class sizes mean you get personal attention at a group class price.

> "Shon is incredible at correcting form and making sure you are getting the most out of your workout. Lots of unique exercises that I wouldn't have thought to do at home/the gym, and definitely will have you sore the next day. Love this place!"

> "Really great, challenging full body circuit class that you can tailor to your level by choosing heavier or lighter weights. I get why everyone raves about Shon in the reviews now, she is so fun and full of energy its infectious. She was also great at correcting form, definitely made sure I was really feeling the muscles we were targeting at all times! Will definitely be back."

> "Super intense class, but with the flexibility to go at your own pace. Loved this time slot -- there were just a few of us, so the instructor was super attentive. It's definitely a class to give it your all! Perfect if you want to sweat and get in a strong, effective workout."

**Rating:** 4.90 (500+ reviews)

## 3. Core Total Fitness

Core Total Fitness delivers the personalized feel of one-on-one training in a small group format. The studio is well-equipped, and trainers like Zach are known for building challenging circuits while adapting on the fly to each person's fitness level. If you want a strength studio where you are treated as an individual -- not just another person in the crowd -- this is it.

> "The studio is beautiful. It has all the right equipment. Zach was a patient kind and encouraging instructor. He created a challenging circuit. It was maybe a little bit too challenging for where I was at, but he grew to understand and was able to adapt the circuit. This is a studio where I am considering a membership outside of ClassPass."

Instructors like Jennifer rotate through creative circuits that hit every muscle group, and the welcoming community keeps people coming back.

> "The good burn! This gym might not look fancy, but this class gets it done. Parking can be a real pain so leave time."
