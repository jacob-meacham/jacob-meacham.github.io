# The best pilates studios in Chicago

Chicago's pilates scene is thriving, and whether you are a first-timer stepping onto a reformer or a seasoned practitioner chasing a deeper burn, the city delivers. We combed through thousands of ClassPass ratings and real member reviews to surface the studios that consistently earn top marks for instruction, atmosphere, and results. Here are the best pilates studios in Chicago right now.

Studios were selected based on review volume, average rating, and consistency of positive feedback from the ClassPass community.

## 1. Reform Studios

Reform Studios has quickly become one of the most talked-about reformer pilates destinations in Chicago. With class formats ranging from Beginner Foundations to the flexibility-focused Lengthen & Tone, there is a clear path for every experience level. Instructors like Felicia, Tamryn, and Celia earn consistent praise for their attentive cueing and hands-on corrections.

> "This class was so refreshing! It was still a workout, but slower paced and more focused on stretching than feeling the burn. Felicia was an amazing instructor, and I'd absolutely recommend this class as an intro to Reformer or as a great option after a high-intensity workout."

> "I recently attended a Pilates class on New Year's Day, and it was an incredible way to kick off the year! Tamryn, our instructor, truly went above and beyond. Her guidance on proper posture and exercise execution was invaluable. I left feeling refreshed and energized."

> "First off, this particular class is not for beginners. With that said it's a perfect combination of what people like about Lagree/Solid Core while actually following the Pilates principles. The instructor was very nice and also very patient."

**Rating:** 4.9 (77 reviews)

## 2. Namastate of Mind

Namastate of Mind is the kind of studio members say they want to keep secret. With small class sizes, gorgeous natural light streaming through rooftop windows, and instructors who remember your name, this intimate reformer studio delivers a boutique experience that feels personal from the first visit.

> "This class was so good I almost want to gatekeep LOL but out of all the classes I've taken on ClassPass this is hands down my favorite. The class size is small which I liked and the instructor was really attentive as well."

> "Tope's class is stellar -- she has such a calming presence and the class is challenging in the best way. She offers modifications and ways to progress a move -- always look forward to a class here!"

> "Ryan was amazing as always -- the burn and variations of movements in his class remain unparalleled. Love having this class as a part of my Saturday."

**Rating:** 5.0 (18 reviews)

## 3. Logan Square Pilates + Core Studio

A neighborhood staple in Logan Square, this studio offers both reformer and tower pilates in a clean, welcoming space. With class types spanning Gentle Reformer to Open Level Tower Pilates, it is one of the most well-rounded pilates studios in the city.

> "This was my first Pilates reformer class and it was excellent! Anita provided very clear and useful instructions. I feel much straighter and stronger leaving the class. I definitely will be back."

> "Daniel is an amazing instructor. He teaches and corrects your form to ensure you are doing the movements correctly. I love that he educates us in the process. Informative and challenging class!"

> "Very welcoming and comforting environment! I was a bit nervous to take a Pilates class as a bigger girl, but it was a lot of fun! Our instructor was great and showed genuine interest in working with us."

**Rating:** 4.9 (34 reviews)

## 4. Metaphysical Pilates

Metaphysical Pilates takes a holistic, classical approach to the practice. This is not a trendy, music-pumping reformer experience -- it is thoughtful, alignment-focused mat work that members say changes the way they carry themselves through the rest of their day.

> "I have never silenced my brain or thought about my alignment of my body in the day to day. This was holistic and healing. I went to work in a different mindset and felt amazing."

> "AMAZING vibe and fantastic instruction. I felt like I was doing some of my best Pilates thanks to the helpful cues and corrections, but I still felt appropriately challenged."

> "Gloria is incredible! Wonderful traditional Pilates class focused on form, posture, and proper breathing. My time in her classes has even shifted my focus areas when I walk, so that I walk with proper posture!"

**Rating:** 5.0 (11 reviews)

## 5. Astute Counseling & Wellness Services -- Fitness

Astute Counseling & Wellness brings a unique, wellness-centered approach to pilates. Housed in a beautiful space with a moss wall and flooded with natural light, this studio blends somatic movement principles with pilates to create classes that are as restorative as they are strengthening.

> "I really loved this class. It's a movement class that encourages you to get into your body as unselfconsciously as possible. The playlist was fabulous and I ended up sweaty and loose by the end. If people did these regularly, there would be far less chronic pain in this world."

> "I love the space! Walked in and immediately felt welcomed -- I'm new to mat Pilates but Kathryn's cues were easy to follow! What a great way to move my body during my lunch break."

**Rating:** 5.0 (5 reviews)

## 6. Asna Yoga & Wellness

Asna Yoga & Wellness brings warmth -- literally. Their heated classes blend yoga and pilates principles in a gorgeous, brand-new studio that members compare to a "bougie vacation with down to earth people." The Yin and Yang hot yoga class builds strength and flexibility in equal measure.

> "First time here and I absolutely loved it! The studio is so warm, cozy, and calming. Great energy here. The instructor was incredible as well, fantastic class structure, cues, playlist, everything. Will definitely be back."

> "Gorgeous space and Loryn was amazing offering adjustments and guiding getting into your body and explaining activations. I left class feeling totally in tune with my body. Will be back!"

**Rating:** 5.0 (6 reviews)

## 7. LevelUp Health & Fitness

LevelUp Health & Fitness is a women-only studio that blends pilates with yoga and high-intensity elements through their PiYo format. The supportive, all-women atmosphere makes it especially welcoming for anyone who wants to build strength without intimidation.
