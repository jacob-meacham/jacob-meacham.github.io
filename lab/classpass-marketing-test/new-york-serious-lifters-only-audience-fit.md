# New York studios where serious lifters actually want to train

You know the difference between a place that has weights and a place that's built for lifting. So do we. We searched over 10,000 reviews across all strength-focused studios in New York -- filtering specifically for members who talk about barbells, squats, deadlifts, kettlebells, and heavy weights -- to find the studios where lifters keep coming back. Not because of flashy amenities, but because of the iron, the coaching, and the people next to them on the platform.

These are the seven New York studios where ClassPass members consistently describe real strength work: progressive loading, form corrections, and classes that leave you genuinely stronger.

## What lifters look for in a New York studio

When we analyzed thousands of lifting-specific reviews from ClassPass members across New York, the same themes kept surfacing.

**Coaching that goes beyond counting reps.** The highest-rated lifting reviews consistently call out coaches who correct form mid-set, adjust programming to the individual, and know the difference between encouraging you and pushing you past your limits. Members want someone who spots the hitch in their deadlift, not someone who just tells them to go heavier.

**Equipment and space that support compound lifts.** Squat racks, barbells, kettlebells, and enough room to move -- lifters care about the fundamentals. Reviews mentioning specific equipment like dumbbells, plates, and cable stacks were concentrated in studios averaging 4.9 stars or higher.

**Programming that builds strength over time.** Members gravitate toward studios offering structured strength work: controlled tempos, progressive loading, and classes designed around compound movements rather than random circuits. The most passionate reviews describe members tracking their progress over months and seeing real, measurable gains.

**A community that shows up ready to work.** Across the top-rated studios, reviewers repeatedly mention the energy in the room and the mix of experience levels training side by side. One member described their studio as offering "almost private training" alongside "a little community you get to be part of."

## Studios where New York lifters go

### LIFTONIC

LIFTONIC in the East Village is purpose-built for lifting, and its 1,108 reviews at a 4.94 average rating reflect a community that takes strength training seriously. Members describe structured sessions with weights ranging from 15 to 50 pounds, resistance bands, and bench work -- with classes organized by muscle group so you can target legs, glutes, upper body, or full-body training on different days. Coaches earn consistent praise for spot-on demonstrations, real-time form corrections, and programming that lets you scale weight up or down based on your level. Multiple members report measurable strength gains over months of consistent attendance.

> "I've been coming to this class for over a year now. When I started I could barely do single-leg squats on the bench, and now I can power through them with a 20-pound weight. I am so much stronger now across the board."

**Rating:** 4.94 (1,108 reviews)

### Strength Society

Members describe coaches who know everyone by name, correct form across the room, and structure sessions so you can adjust weight up or down without falling behind.

The mix of beginners and regulars training side by side creates an encouraging atmosphere without watering down the intensity.

Multiple reviewers report transformative results over three to six months, describing it as a space that changed how they view what their bodies can do.
