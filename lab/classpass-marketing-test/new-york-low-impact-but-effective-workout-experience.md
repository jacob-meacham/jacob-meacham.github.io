# Low-impact classes in New York that still deliver a serious workout

Low-impact doesn't mean low-effort. It just means your joints are along for the ride, not paying the price.

This distinction matters -- especially if you're managing an injury, protecting a finicky knee, or simply tired of classes that leave you hobbling for three days. The best low-impact classes deliver the burn you came for, the strength gains you wanted, and the ability to walk normally the next morning. And New York has plenty of them.

We searched thousands of reviews across the entire New York ClassPass community looking specifically for studios where members describe the same experience: they expected something gentle and got something genuinely challenging. The studios below kept coming up -- not because they're easy, but because they're effective in a way that respects your body.

## What the reviews actually say

The phrase that appears again and again across these studios is some version of "I didn't expect it to be that hard." Members who walked in expecting a relaxed stretch session came out shaking, sweating, and immediately looking for the next available class. The reviewers who use words like "deceptively," "surprisingly," and "still challenging" are describing something specific: the sensation of working hard without the pounding, the impact, or the soreness that sidelines you.

That's the combination these studios have earned a reputation for delivering.

## Studios where low-impact means anything but easy

### Holydog Pilates

Holydog Pilates has become one of New York's most-reviewed Pilates studios, with 2,813 reviews and a 4.95 average rating. Members who come in managing injuries or looking for something gentler on their joints consistently describe walking out having worked harder than they expected. Instructors watch the room closely, offering hands-on corrections and modifications that keep the challenge intact while keeping the movement safe. The review that captures this studio best: "kind and supportive" and "still challenging" in the same breath.
