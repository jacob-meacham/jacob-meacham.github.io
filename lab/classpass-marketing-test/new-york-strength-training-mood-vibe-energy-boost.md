# When you need a spark: strength training for an energy boost in New York

There are days when the city's pace outpaces your own — when you're dragging through the afternoon and the couch is calling louder than the gym. Counterintuitively, the best antidote isn't rest. It's the kind of focused, full-body effort that flips a switch inside you. New York's strength training community has found the studios that don't just build muscle — they build momentum.

## Why strength training helps with energy

Lifting heavy things wakes your body up in ways that cardio alone can't. The combination of focused effort, clear progressions, and the satisfaction of measurable improvement creates a feedback loop that members describe as genuinely energizing. You walk out standing taller, thinking clearer, and ready for what's next.

## Studios our community loves for this

### Liftonic

Liftonic has earned a devoted following for strength sessions that leave members feeling powered up rather than depleted. The screen-guided format, attentive instructors, and emphasis on proper form create an experience that's intense but never punishing — and the energy in the room is contagious.

> "I like this one because I know I need to strength train but I'm too intimidated to do it myself at the gym, and this one doesn't have a crazy cardio component so I'm energized and not exhausted after. Highly recommend!"

> "Milan provides quintessential best in class level of instruction which elevates program and sequencing to great effect. Spot on queues, key corrections, genuine connection to the work — uplifting spirit is a whole vibe."

### The Class

The Class blends breathwork, dance, and strength-inspired movement into something members describe as freeing, grounding, and awakening all at once. It's less about reps and more about releasing what's weighing you down — and leaving with energy you didn't know you had.

> "Deeply engaging regimen to perhaps help release energy and ideas that do not serve us from the body, whilst strengthening, mobilizing, and mindfully adapting energetic frequencies."

> "This felt like if Pilates, yoga, barre, breath work, dance, and therapy had a baby. Freeing, grounding, and awakening."

### The Training Lab

The Training Lab delivers no-frills, high-quality strength programming with a camaraderie that members say makes every session feel like a team effort. The mix of heavy lifting, conditioning, and plyo leaves you buzzing — in the best way.

> "Amazing hard workout! Great mix of plyo, heavy lift, conditioning and strength. Really friendly folks in class, a lot of camaraderie and focus on getting in a killer workout."

> "Just when I think I can't push anymore, Jose always motivates me to give a little more! Consistency has been key — I'm feeling and seeing the continued improvement."

### Fhitting Room

Fhitting Room's welcoming, high-energy classes meet members wherever they are and push them just enough to leave every session feeling accomplished and alive. The supportive coaching and smart programming keep the energy high without tipping into burnout.

> "First time here, it was very welcoming. Love the class format — really nice and supportive for everyone! Great pace and workout for all levels."
