# The best pilates studios in Miami

Miami's pilates scene is thriving -- and whether you are chasing reformer burns in South Beach, lagree shakes in Midtown, or classical mat work in Coral Gables, the city delivers world-class studios at every turn. We dug into thousands of real ClassPass member ratings and reviews to surface the seven studios that consistently earn the highest marks. Here are the best pilates studios in Miami.

Studios were selected based on review volume, average rating, and consistency of positive feedback from the ClassPass community.

## 1. The Pilates Place -- Miami

The Pilates Place is a perennial favorite among Miami's pilates devotees. With multiple class formats -- reformer power circuits, tower sessions, and "Fun with Toys" reformer classes that mix in props -- the studio keeps things fresh while staying rooted in classical technique. Instructors JP and Bettina are consistently name-checked in reviews for their deep anatomical knowledge and attention to proper form.

> "JP is so wonderful. He is extremely knowledgable about pilates technique and the body. Class was the right mix of strengthening, toning and stretching. My spine feels amazing."

> "It has been a few months since I have taken Bettina's class and I was reminded of the wealth of knowledge and experience Bettina has in teaching pilates. It would be truly difficult to find a more capable and versatile teacher. The classes are never boring and always challenging and very safe."

**Rating:** 4.93 (500+ reviews)

## 2. Reforming Pilates -- Bay Harbor Islands

Reforming Pilates has built a devoted following in Bay Harbor, and it is easy to see why. Members describe the studio as "the nicest studio in Miami by far" and rave about the breadth of instructor talent -- from Elisa's science-level programming to Briana's masterful low-rep burnout sequences.

> "I love this studio so much. It is the nicest studio in Miami by far. I have been to their Miami Beach location loads which is 10/10. The staff, environment and community are unmatched."

> "Elisa is one of a kind! Her classes are like pure science where she thinks about every single detail and tiny muscles in our body to be activated!"

> "Beautiful studio, lovely instructor and amazing class. Classical reformer Pilates but more challenging than your average class. 10/10 recommend!"

**Rating:** 4.94 (500+ reviews)

## 3. The Pilates Place -- South Beach

The South Beach outpost of The Pilates Place brings the same classical pedigree to the beach. Instructor Adriana is a standout -- members describe her as a "miracle teacher" with 12-plus years of devoted clients. Classes span beginner foundations through advanced reformer challenges, all with a focus on proper form and the mind-body connection.

> "I have been Adriana's pilates client for about 12 years. Adriana's classes are very challenging and fun at the same time. She creates safe and creative sequences that have been keeping me in shape and free of injury over the years."

> "I loved class with Adriana. Her passion for proper form and the mind body connection ensures you get the most out of each movement. I left feeling refreshed, strengthened and lengthened!"

> "The class was great -- true classical Pilates. Peri was an excellent instructor, very thorough, kind, and attentive. Highly recommend!"

**Rating:** 4.97 (498 reviews)

## 4. Megalit. A Lagree Fitness Studio

If you want the slow-burn, muscle-shaking intensity of lagree, Megalit is the studio to beat. Classes cap at 10 students, and the studio is flooded with natural light and surrounded by art.

> "There is a reason why this studio won ClassPass Insider awards as well as Yelp awards. I have been doing Pilates for 5+ years but lagree is no joke! If you're looking for something similar to Pilates but with more strength training, this is the studio for you."

> "Koko is amazing -- her transitions are quick so if you're new you might be a little confused in your first few classes, but I love how challenging her classes are. She always has new moves mixed in and actually corrects your form."

**Rating:** 4.95 (500+ reviews)

## 5. [solidcore] -- Midtown Miami

[solidcore] needs little introduction -- the national brand has a passionate following, and the Midtown Miami location lives up to the hype. Their signature Megaformer-based classes deliver high-intensity pilates that will humble even experienced athletes.

> "I died and came back to life lol -- that was a killer workout. Super challenging class. Instructor was really helpful with adjustments but definitely not a class for beginners!"

> "Amazing! I love when a coach is constantly holding you accountable. From the moment class started, Sydney was super motivating and funny and attentive. My legs were literally shaking and my arms wanted to fall off. Insanely great class."

**Rating:** 4.95 (500+ reviews)

## 6. TREMBLE -- Coral Gables

TREMBLE is a fast-growing Miami-born reformer pilates brand with four locations across South Florida. Their signature "Full Body TREMBLE" class is a reformer-based session designed to push you to the shake point. Instructors like Adelyn, Karina, and Rodrigo earn consistent praise for clear cueing, form corrections, and welcoming energy.

> "Adelyn was amazing! Explained everything so well and was constantly making sure we were doing the exercises correctly. Had me SWEATING! Felt so good after."

> "Karina was truly a great example of what an instructor should be. She was instructing properly, would walk around to make sure you are in the correct form, and overall was fun yet challenging!"

> "Rodrigo is an excellent Pilates instructor! His clear guidance and focus on proper form have really helped improve my strength and flexibility. Highly recommend!"

**Rating:** 4.88 (500+ reviews)

## 7. Kenergy Pilates

Kenergy Pilates is a boutique gem with an industrial-organic design aesthetic that members love. The studio offers specialized formats like "Buns and Abs of Steel" alongside full-body pilates sessions. Instructor Karina stands out for her hands-on corrections and deep knowledge.

> "Not only is this place tastefully decorated with an incredible vibe, industrial organic, the instructor is extremely knowledgeable and experienced! My favorite pilates place in Miami hands down. You are missing out if you haven't been here yet!"

> "Karina is a really great instructor. She knows her stuff and explains it well. I find that not only does the emphasis on correct form help me in class, but I also apply it outside of class. Studio is great: clean, light filled and welcoming and parking is easy."

**Rating:** 4.94 (282 reviews)
