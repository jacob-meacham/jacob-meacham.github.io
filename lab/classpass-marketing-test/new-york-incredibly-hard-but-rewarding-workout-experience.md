# The hardest classes in New York that you'll want to take again and again

Some people scroll the schedule looking for the class that sounds the most intense. Not because they love suffering -- but because they've figured something out: the harder the class, the better you feel when it's over. That post-class high, the shaky legs, the quiet pride of knowing you didn't quit -- it's addictive.

We analyzed over 13,700 reviews across New York studios on ClassPass to find the places where members consistently describe the experience as brutally challenging and deeply rewarding. These are the classes that make you question your life choices mid-set, then book again the next morning.

## What makes a class "hard but rewarding"

It's not just about being difficult. Plenty of classes can exhaust you. The ones that earn the "hard but rewarding" label in review after review share a few things in common: thoughtful programming that pushes you progressively, coaching that guides you through the tough moments instead of just counting reps, and an atmosphere where everyone in the room is working toward that same finish line.

Across the reviews we analyzed, words like "challenging" appeared alongside "encouraging," "motivating," and "accomplished" far more often than they appeared alongside complaints. That pattern tells a clear story -- when the difficulty is intentional and well-coached, members don't just survive the class. They love it.

## Classes that will test you in New York

### FORM50 Fitness

With locations in Williamsburg and Midtown East, FORM50 has quietly become one of New York's most talked-about studios for members who want to be genuinely humbled.

Across over 2,100 reviews and a 4.95 average rating, one word appears constantly: hardest.

### [solidcore]

If you've never tried a megaformer class, [solidcore] in Chelsea will introduce you to muscles you didn't know you had.

With over 1,200 reviews and a 4.93 average rating, the consensus is clear: you will be sore, and you will come back.

## Ready to earn that feeling?

The best part of the hardest class on the schedule isn't the class itself -- it's the moment right after, when your legs are wobbling and your heart is still pounding and you realize you just did something most people wouldn't even attempt. That feeling doesn't come from easy. It comes from earning it.
