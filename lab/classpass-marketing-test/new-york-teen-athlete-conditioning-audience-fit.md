# Skipped -- insufficient data

**Theme:** Teen Athlete Conditioning
**City:** New York (MSA_ID 1)
**Page type:** audience_fit

## Data summary

A keyword search across `CP_BI_DERIVED.DATAPIPELINE.SCORE_COMMENTS` joined to `CP_BI_DERIVED.DATAPIPELINE.TOPS_CLASS_DATA` (MSA_ID = 1, RATING >= 4, comment length > 30) returned 80 reviews matching 12 keyword patterns related to teens, youth, and conditioning.

However, on manual review, the overwhelming majority of these results do not describe dedicated teen athlete conditioning programs:

- **"conditioning" keyword matches (~55 reviews):** Nearly all refer to adult strength-and-conditioning or boxing-conditioning classes. These are general fitness reviews from adult members, not teen-specific programming.
- **"my daughter" / "my son" / "my kid" keyword matches (~10 reviews):** These describe parent-child outings -- a parent bringing their child to a cycling class, a family visiting a pool, a mother-daughter Pilates session. While positive, none describe structured teen athlete conditioning programs.
- **"high school" keyword matches (~5 reviews):** Almost entirely nostalgic references ("I haven't taken a dance class since high school," "reminded me of high school cheerleading"). One review mentioned a studio located near a high school building. None describe current teen participation in conditioning classes.
- **"teen" / "teenager" keyword matches (~4 reviews):** One review mentions a mixed karate class with teens present. One mentions a facial for a teen. The others use "teen" in passing (e.g., "teen pop-y music"). None describe teen athlete conditioning.
- **"youth" / "young athlete" / "student athlete" matches:** Zero relevant results.
- **"age group" matches (~2 reviews):** References to diverse age groups attending general classes, not teen-specific programming.

### Studio qualification assessment

| Criteria | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Total keyword-matched reviews | 80 |
| Reviews genuinely about teen participation in conditioning | ~5-7 |
| Distinct studios with genuine teen-relevant reviews | 5-7 |
| Studios with 2+ teen-relevant reviews | 0 |
| Studios meeting 20+ total review threshold with teen conditioning signal | 0 |

**Fewer than 3 studios** have meaningful, theme-relevant review density for "Teen Athlete Conditioning." The keyword matches are dominated by false positives -- adults discussing their own conditioning classes and incidental mentions of children or high school memories.

## Decision

**Skipped -- insufficient data.** This page cannot be generated with authentic, review-backed content because the ClassPass review corpus for New York does not contain enough genuine signal about teen athlete conditioning experiences. Generating a page from these results would require either misrepresenting adult conditioning reviews as teen-relevant or stretching incidental parent-child mentions into a narrative about teen athlete programming -- both of which would violate the Straightforward & Trustworthy brand voice pillar and the rule to "be clear and honest -- no fine-print tricks or misleading claims."

## Recommendations

- **Revisit if teen-specific programming expands.** If ClassPass partners in New York begin offering and tagging dedicated teen conditioning, youth sports performance, or high-school-athlete classes, this page could be regenerated with authentic data.
- **Consider adjacent themes.** A "Family-friendly studios in New York" audience_fit page may be viable using the parent-child review signal that surfaced in this search.
