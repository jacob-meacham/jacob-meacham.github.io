# The best yoga studios in Miami

Miami's yoga scene is as vibrant and diverse as the city itself. Whether you are chasing a sweat-drenching power flow in Aventura, a restorative candlelit yin practice on Miami Beach, or a brewery-hosted vinyasa in Fort Lauderdale, South Florida delivers world-class studios with instructors who genuinely care about your practice. We analyzed thousands of ClassPass member ratings and reviews to surface the seven highest-rated yoga studios in the Miami/South Florida metro.

Studios were selected based on review volume, average rating, and consistency of positive feedback from the ClassPass community.

## 1. YogaSix Aventura

YogaSix Aventura dominates the Miami yoga rankings with five distinct class formats, each earning 500+ reviews and ratings above 4.85. The studio caters to every mood: the Signature Hot class delivers an intense heated vinyasa, the Power Flow builds strength and empowerment, and the Restore class lets you melt into deep relaxation.

> "Absolutely phenomenal... loving Loreta more and more. Her words are said in such an inspiring way. She corrects form and her music is on point. You're so stress free in her space. I really enjoyed it to the moon and back! Great workout -- burn calories while challenging your body."

> "Y6 Aventura has the best teachers in the area, and I visit all studios regularly! Michi was subbing for the Restore class and although I can see she is probably awesome at her Power and Sculpt classes, she did a wonderful job with the Restore as well."

> "Extremely excellent class. Exceptional guide. Challenges you, corrects form and assists when necessary. She is very skilled in her craft and I felt like a talented student under her guidance."

**Rating:** 4.93 (500+ reviews)

## 2. State of Yoga

State of Yoga on Miami Beach is a standout for practitioners seeking an authentic, soulful practice. Their Vinyasa Flow builds strength and balance, while the Jivamukti Open class weaves together philosophy, meditation, and eclectic music ranging from Indian kirtan to hip-hop.

> "Karina is one of a kind, super authentic. You can feel her genuine energy throughout the class. I'll definitely be back. Loved her flow!"

> "I loved this class! The practice was amazing -- challenging yet grounding, and so well-guided. I only wish I had Karina teaching in Boston! The studio itself is also super cute, adding to the overall experience."

> "Belu's classes are always deeply transformative. She drives you to become aware of parts of the body and the various ways they can move by way of what feels like a very challenging (but still completely accessible) dance. Super important and fun class!"

**Rating:** 4.98 (500+ reviews)

## 3. Energy Yoga and Wellness Center

Energy Yoga and Wellness Center in Doral is a Miami institution with a staggering breadth of offerings. The Dharma Flow class is a transformative heated experience built around philosophical themes, while the Hatha class provides grounding and spaciousness. A true differentiator: they offer Aligned Flow en Espanol, making authentic yoga accessible to Miami's Spanish-speaking community.

> "I have been to lots of yoga studios in Miami, and this is my favorite one that I will always keep coming back to. Every instructor I've had here is great and so kind."

## 4. Bodhi Yoga

Bodhi Yoga is where serious practitioners go to deepen their craft. Their Guided Ashtanga class holds a remarkable 4.96 mean rating across 325 reviews -- one of the highest single-class scores in the entire Miami metro. What sets Bodhi apart is the caliber of instruction: multiple reviewers who are yoga teachers themselves cite Bodhi as their go-to for sequencing inspiration.

> "I LOVE this class, low key one of the best classes at one of the best studios in Miami. These people are serious about their yoga... I teach yoga, and I come here to get sequencing inspiration. Must visit if you care about your yoga!"

> "What an incredible session presented by Stephanie. I am so grateful for following my gut and attending this class for the first (and definitely not last) time. The space is so calming and light. Exactly what I didn't know I needed."

> "I took my first yoga class ever back in 2017 with Michelle, and the best way I can describe that experience is that it was transformational. It kickstarted my love for yoga, something I've been practicing ever since to this day."

**Rating:** 4.96 (500+ reviews)

## 5. Synergy Yoga

Located in the heart of South Beach, Synergy Yoga offers a challenging and authentic practice that draws both locals and visitors. The Ashtanga Inspired class is led by instructors who offer variations throughout, making the practice accessible whether you are a first-timer or a seasoned yogi.

> "Great class! I always try to do Elisa's class when I am in Miami. Her power classes are energizing yet calming. I love how I feel after her classes! She is an engaging and attentive teacher who adapts poses to work for everyone."

> "So glad I booked this class. Patricia was my instructor and we curated the class based on my needs and energy. She was incredible and this was easily the most connected I have ever felt during a yoga class."

**Rating:** 4.90 (355 reviews)

> "Madi is an amazing yoga instructor. Her vinyasa class aligns my body, strengthens and stretches me. Her class is never the same and always feels new. She's hands on, helpful and brings on so much peace and tranquility!"

> "Mauricio is legit my favorite instructor! I leave that class with my muscles melted and relaxed and straight to sleep when I get home. I'd like to think that these classes have helped me scale back from having to see the chiropractor as often."

**Rating:** 4.98 (750+ reviews)

## 7. Hanu Yoga Studio

Hanu Yoga Studio on Miami Beach is the go-to destination for candlelit, meditative yoga in South Florida. Their signature Candlelight Yin class offers a deeply restorative experience that complements more dynamic practices. The bright, welcoming studio space and afternoon class options make it especially convenient.

> "Love the brightness in the studio and that it has afternoon class options. I wouldn't say the class is entirely gentle, as I did sweat, but it felt awesome! It's definitely friendly for anyone at any level. Romina showed genuine interest in knowing each student and made us feel welcomed."

> "Wonderful class. Jess is a fantastic guide. She's very welcoming, kind, gentle, and supportive. This is a gentle yoga class with slow sequencing, which was exactly what I needed."

> "Excellent class! The instructor is very calming and kind. The class was a mix of vinyasas and seated positions with stretching. I could modify anything and it was definitely for all levels. I'll definitely be back."
