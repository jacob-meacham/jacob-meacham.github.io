# The best coaching you'll find in New York

New York has thousands of studios, but the ones you keep coming back to almost always share one thing: a coach who genuinely changes how you move. We searched through coaching-focused reviews across all New York studios on ClassPass — filtering for the keywords and sentiments that signal truly standout instruction — and surfaced the places where the community consistently celebrates the people leading class. These are studios where coaches correct your form, explain the why behind every movement, and make every level feel welcome.

## What sets great coaching apart

Across thousands of reviews, a clear pattern emerges. The coaches who earn the most praise in New York do more than keep time and count reps. They offer hands-on adjustments without making you feel singled out, provide modifications so every ability level can thrive in the same room, and bring an energy that pushes you without overwhelming you. They remember where you left off, check in on injuries, and build sequences with purpose. It's the difference between going through the motions and actually getting better at something.

## Studios where New York's best coaches lead every class

### Sui Yoga Soho

Sui Yoga Soho leads the pack with 4,252 reviews and a 4.92 average rating, and the coaching quality is the thread that ties every glowing review together.

This surfaced studios with deeper coaching signal that the top-venue-first approach missed entirely.
