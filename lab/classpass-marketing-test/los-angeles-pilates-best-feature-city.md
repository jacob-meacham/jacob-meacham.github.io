# The best pilates studios in Los Angeles

Los Angeles is a city that lives and breathes wellness, and its pilates scene is no exception. Whether you are chasing the slow burn of a Lagree megaformer, the precision of classical reformer work, or the grounding focus of a mat session, LA and Orange County deliver world-class studios on nearly every corner. We dug into thousands of ClassPass member reviews to surface the studios that consistently earn the highest praise -- places where the instructors remember your name, correct your form mid-flow, and leave you shaking in the best possible way. Here are seven standout pilates studios that real members keep coming back to.

Studios were selected based on review volume, average rating, and consistency of positive feedback from the ClassPass community.

## 1. The Studio (MDR) -- Playa Vista

The Studio (MDR) has become a Westside institution for Lagree-method pilates. Their megaformer classes range from the approachable Essentials format to the all-out Total Body session, and both earn near-perfect marks from ClassPass members. Instructors here are known for being warm, precise, and unrelenting -- exactly what you want when the shakes set in at minute twenty.

> "Dani was super helpful by demonstrating moves and correcting my form. She gave great cues on modifications to make everything achievable for beginners but also ways to make it more advanced. Loved the music too!"

> "Balanced full body workout with heavy resistance, got the shakes and was dripping sweat by end of class. Definitely will feel sore, but in a good way!"

**Rating:** 4.92 (500+ reviews)

## 2. SeaFit Huntington Beach

SeaFit brings the megaformer experience to the coast, and members love the personal attention they receive in every class. Instructors here do not just call out cues from the front of the room -- they walk the floor, demonstrate alongside you, and physically adjust your positioning until you are getting every ounce of benefit from each movement.

> "Saghi walked me through every step and helped me position my body and feet. She made me feel comfortable and more motivated. I'm definitely coming back for more -- it's a great workout!"

**Rating:** 4.92 (500+ reviews)

## 3. Lagree213 -- Historic Core, Los Angeles

Tucked into the Historic Core of downtown LA, Lagree213 delivers a high-energy, music-driven megaformer workout that has earned a fiercely loyal following. Members highlight the studio's variety of instructors, each bringing a distinct style while maintaining consistently excellent form cues and creative programming.

> "Rachel's my favorite instructor at Lagree213! She really brings up your heart rate and keeps it high during the entire workout. I definitely felt the shakes throughout and she executed a great sequence."

> "Melissa was so sweet and patient with me during this class. I needed a lot of modifications because of a back injury so she came around and helped me a lot and didn't make me feel uncomfortable about it."

**Rating:** 4.90 (500+ reviews)

## 4. ASPYN METHOD -- Redondo Beach

ASPYN METHOD stands out for its intimate class sizes -- capped at just five clients per reformer session -- which means you get near-private-lesson attention at a group class price. Instructors invest real time in understanding your goals and adjusting sequences to your level, making this a favorite for both newcomers and seasoned practitioners.

> "She was one of the best instructors I've had in 5 years of Pilates. She had us stretch before getting into the heavy workouts and she paid very close attention to every single person in the class."

**Rating:** 4.90 (500+ reviews)

## 5. Sweat House OC -- Mission Viejo

Sweat House OC delivers an intense Lagree megaformer workout in a clean, welcoming environment that members describe as challenging but never intimidating. The instructors here are especially praised for how they treat first-timers -- greeting you at the door, walking you through the equipment, and checking in before you leave.

> "Erin is awesome! It was my first time doing Lagree but she made it easy to follow along. Her directions are clear and she demonstrates everything so you can catch on quickly."

**Rating:** 4.88 (433 reviews)

## 6. Love Your Core Pilates & More -- Torrance

Love Your Core offers a refreshingly traditional approach to pilates in the South Bay. With both reformer and mat classes on the schedule, this studio is known for its cozy, homey atmosphere and instructors who take time to meet every student where they are. It is a standout choice for anyone who wants mindful, form-focused pilates without the high-intensity frenzy.

> "Space is cozy and homey! I love that MaryKay was very aware of everyone's levels and abilities. I think this studio is more of traditional, lowkey pilates that I would recommend for people of all ages and experience!"

**Rating:** 4.88 (500+ reviews)
