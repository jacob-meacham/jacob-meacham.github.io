# New York studios with zero intimidation factor

Walking into a new studio for the first time can feel like showing up to a party where you don't know anyone. Your heart beats a little faster. You wonder if everyone else already knows what they're doing. That feeling is completely normal -- and thousands of ClassPass members in New York have been right where you are. We searched through reviews across the entire New York metro to find studios where members consistently use words like "welcoming," "comfortable," "no judgment," and "at ease" -- not once, but over and over again.

These aren't just studios with high ratings. They're the places where the community has gone out of its way to say: you belong here.

## What makes a studio feel non-intimidating

Across the reviews we analyzed, a few patterns kept showing up. Instructors who greet newcomers and check in throughout class. Staff who offer modifications without being asked, meeting you where you are instead of where they think you should be. Small class sizes where you're a person, not a number. And a genuine sense of community -- other members who smile, make space, and remember what it felt like to be new.

The seven studios below earned their spot because their reviews mention these qualities dozens of times, not as a lucky one-off but as a consistent part of the experience.

## Studios our community loves for their welcoming vibe

Even members who felt nervous about the format beforehand describe leaving with plans to return.

> "This was my first yoga class ever and it was so welcoming. The atmosphere and space felt very nice, relaxing, and safe. A great variety of poses that fit all levels, making it easy for everyone to join in at their own pace."
