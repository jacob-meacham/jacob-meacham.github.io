# Your first studio visit in New York should feel this good

Walking into a studio for the first time can bring up a lot of feelings — excitement, curiosity, and yes, a few butterflies. Where do you put your things? Will the instructor acknowledge you're new? Will you feel out of place? We searched thousands of reviews across New York studios on ClassPass, filtering specifically for first-timer feedback, to find the spots where newcomers consistently describe feeling welcomed, guided, and genuinely glad they showed up.

## What makes a great first studio experience

Across hundreds of first-visit reviews, a few themes come up again and again. The best studios for newcomers share these qualities: instructors who check in with you before class starts, clear explanations of what to expect, thoughtful modifications so you're never left guessing, and a community that makes you feel like you belong from the moment you walk in. It's less about the class itself and more about how supported you feel doing it.

## New York studios where first-timers feel right at home

### Pilates Habitat

With over 2,000 reviews and a 4.94 average rating, Pilates Habitat stands out for making beginners feel at ease on the reformer from the very first visit. Reviewers highlight patient instructors who explain every movement clearly, work with two different machines to keep things engaging, and tailor the intensity so newcomers feel challenged without feeling lost. The intimate class size — a maximum of six people — means you get the kind of attention that makes all the difference when everything is brand new.

> "It was my first time ever doing Pilates, and the instructor explained everything so clearly that I could easily follow along. We got to use two different machines, which made the class really fun and engaging. The class was well-paced, supportive, and never felt intimidating for a beginner."

Whether you're stepping into your first hot yoga class or trying vinyasa for the first time, the atmosphere here is designed to make you feel at home, not on display.

> "This was my first time here and I will definitely be back. I felt welcomed the second I walked in and the instructor was such an amazing guide. It was a great class and the ending made me feel so relaxed and at peace."

### CycleBar

From helping you pick out your cycling shoes to getting your bike set up before class, the staff walks you through the whole process. Once the lights drop and the music starts, instructors keep things encouraging without putting anyone on the spot — the kind of energy that turns a nervous first ride into a new weekly ritual.

> "This was my first cycle class and my first spin class in general, and I had such an amazing time.

### Rumble Boxing

Never thrown a punch before? Rumble Boxing's 4.95 average across more than 2,800 reviews says you're in good hands. Reviewers describe an environment where the energy is high but the vibe is zero judgment — instructors demonstrate every combination clearly, check in with first-timers throughout the class, and make sure you feel empowered, not overwhelmed. The mix of boxing rounds and strength training keeps things dynamic, and the dim lighting means nobody is watching you figure out your jab.

> "Such an amazing first experience at Rumble Boxing. The class was challenging but fun, and the energy was incredible. The instructor was super supportive and encouraging the entire time, and really made me feel comfortable and motivated."

## Data extraction report

**Method:** SCORE_COMMENTS-first keyword search across ALL New York venues (MSA_ID = 1), not limited to TOPS_IN_CITY venue pool.

**Keyword search:** 12 first-timer/welcome keywords across SCORE_COMMENTS joined to TOPS_CLASS_DATA. Returned 80 top-scored matching reviews, then grouped by VENUE_ID to surface studios with the highest concentration of first-timer praise.

**Studios selected (7) with validation:**
