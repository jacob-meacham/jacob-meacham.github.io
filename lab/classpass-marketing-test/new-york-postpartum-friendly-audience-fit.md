# Postpartum-friendly studios in New York that reviewers trust

Stepping back into a studio during or after pregnancy is a deeply personal decision. You want a space that feels safe, where someone understands your body right now -- not the body you had six months ago or the one you're told you should have next month. You want to move at your own pace, ask questions without judgment, and maybe connect with others who get it.

We searched thousands of ClassPass community reviews across the entire New York area to find studios where people specifically talk about their prenatal and postpartum experiences. Not just studios with high ratings overall, but the places where reviewers mention feeling supported, accommodated, and genuinely cared for during this stage of life. These seven studios stood out.

## What makes a studio postpartum-friendly

The studios on this list share a few things in common, according to the reviews: instructors who proactively offer modifications without being asked, classes specifically designed around the prenatal and postpartum experience, a welcoming atmosphere where you can bring your little one or simply show up as you are, and a sense of community with others going through a similar chapter. That combination of expertise and warmth is what keeps coming up in the reviews, and it's what guided this list.

> "I wish I had discovered Freya early on in my pregnancy. I'm in my third trimester and the classes are the perfect mix of challenging and restorative. All the instructors I've met have been really great. The studio is such a warm and welcoming environment and I've enjoyed connecting with other mamas to be."

> "What a wonderful class! The instructors are doulas too, which is amazing. I feel so lucky to have found a studio that specializes in pre and postnatal care -- and with that comes a community of others who are going through the same things as me."

Their prenatal Pilates offering stands out because reviewers are pleasantly surprised by how much they get to do -- not a watered-down experience, but a thoughtful class that uses reformer and Cadillac equipment in ways that feel safe and engaging.

> "It was more interesting and fun than I thought. Since it's a prenatal class I thought we wouldn't get to use the reformer, but we did. Half the time on the Cadillac and half on the reformer."

> "It meant the world to me to be able to get out of the house for the first time and stretch my body properly for the first time since birth. It was such a wonderful mix of working with my baby's needs and my needs at the same time, artfully switching up the program throughout. It's not just stretches for the parent but also some baby movement education as well."

> "This is my first pregnancy and I was not expecting this much lower back pain. Desperate for some relief, I came to this class -- and I'm totally addicted. The instructor is fantastic, encourages us to take breaks if we need it, and the class is truly gentle enough for anyone."
