# Studios where the music hits different in New York

We searched thousands of reviews across New York studios looking for one thing: where do ClassPass members lose themselves in the music? Not just background noise, but playlists and sound systems that transform a class from something you push through into something you never want to end. From cycling rooms that feel like a concert to yoga flows backed by hip-hop beats, these are the New York studios where the soundtrack earned its own standing ovation.

## Why music makes or breaks a class

It's the difference between watching the clock and losing track of time entirely. Across hundreds of reviews, ClassPass members in New York consistently point to music as the invisible ingredient that elevates everything. The right playlist sets the pace for a cycling climb, builds emotional momentum through a yoga flow, and turns a tough final set into something you actually push through instead of quit. Members describe feeling like they're "in a club" during dance cardio, getting so caught up in the beats that they push harder without realizing it, and walking out buzzing from the energy of a perfectly curated soundtrack. When the music is right, the class doesn't feel like exercise. It feels like an experience.

## Studios where the music slaps in New York

### CycleBar

With multiple locations across New York, CycleBar has become synonymous with music-driven cycling. Members don't just mention the playlists -- they obsess over them. From pop punk theme rides to warehouse techno Wednesdays, the classes here are built around the music as much as the ride. Instructors match beat drops to sprints and choreograph entire sequences to the rhythm, so you're never just pedaling -- you're performing. Members describe it as their "favorite class of all time" thanks to "perfect matching of the music to the workout," and first-timers regularly walk out already planning their next visit.

> "Perfect soundtrack, perfect pacing, perfect matching of the music to the workout. 10/10 across the board."

> "Most fun I had in a while working out. A great techno playlist that really helps to keep up with the flow."

**Rating:** 4.9 (500+ reviews)

### SoulCycle

SoulCycle's New York locations consistently show up in music-related reviews more than almost any other brand in the city. What sets these classes apart is how deeply music is woven into the entire ride -- members describe playlists that build emotional arcs, from warm-up grooves to full-room singalongs during the climbs. The instructors here curate their own mixes, and the result is that no two rides feel the same. Whether you're at the Brooklyn Heights, Williamsburg, or Upper West Side location, the vibe is always music-first. Members rave about rides that leave them "literally in tears" from the emotional energy and playlists they call "flawless" and "fire."

> "The energy was unmatched and truly made me push myself more because of it. I loved the pacing of the class and loved the playlist."

> "The music was fun and encouraging. It felt like the instructor eased us into the more intense stuff in a way that didn't feel abrupt."

**Rating:** 4.9 (500+ reviews)

### VAURA Pilates

This Upper East Side studio proves that Pilates doesn't have to be quiet to be effective. VAURA wraps reformer classes in colored lights, floor-to-ceiling mirrors, and playlists that members compare to a night out. The music here isn't just on in the background -- it drives the rhythm of the class, matching the pace of reps and transitions so naturally that even a challenging sequence feels like it flows. Members consistently call it an "ethereal experience" and describe the combination of lights and music as unlike any other Pilates studio in New York.

> "It was like walking into a club with the lights and music. Really had a fun time!"

> "This isn't your traditional reformer Pilates class. It is much more fast paced and there is an incredible playlist playing throughout the entire class. I found myself smiling throughout."

**Rating:** 4.8 (500+ reviews)

### Y7 Studio

Y7 flipped the script on what a yoga class sounds like. Instead of ambient nature sounds, you're flowing through vinyasa sequences to hip-hop, R&B, and pop in a candlelit, mirror-free room. The darkness and the music create a space where you can focus entirely on how your body feels without worrying about how it looks. Members describe the experience as "the perfect marriage of a yoga class and Pilates class" with beat-based movement, and first-timers regularly say they "knew within the first 10 minutes" they'd be coming back. With locations across the city, Y7 has carved out a niche as the studio where the music is as integral as the poses.

> "It was dark and candlelit, but still had the vibes with great music and beat-based movement. The perfect marriage of a yoga class and Pilates class."

> "The instructor brought in some astrology and spiritual moments to the class while also playing fun music."

**Rating:** 4.8 (500+ reviews)

### Harlem Cycle

Harlem Cycle brings an energy that's distinctly its own -- independently owned with a community-first feel where the music reflects the neighborhood's soul. Members rave about "fresh playlists" that match the welcoming, high-energy vibe of every ride. The instructors here are known for making first-timers feel immediately at ease while still delivering classes that push you. The combination of a supportive atmosphere and playlists that have members "burning more calories from being so hyped" has earned this studio one of the highest ratings in the city.

> "This place is amazing! Fresh playlist, amazing energy from the instructor -- great energy all around the room."

> "The music was great. As a first-time spinner, the instructor made it a point to always include 'to your own level' with her instructions, which made me feel good about going at my own pace."

**Rating:** 5.0 (500+ reviews)

### SaltDrop

SaltDrop in Manhattan blends dance, sculpt, and Pilates-inspired movement into classes where the music is a co-star, not a backdrop. Members describe the playlists as the best they've heard in any New York class -- the kind of music that has you dancing during glute bridges and losing yourself in the vibe so completely that the class feels more like a night out than a workout. The studio's welcoming atmosphere and creative programming keep members coming back, but it's the curated sound that turns a great class into something unforgettable.

> "The playlist was so good and it honestly felt like I was in a club the entire time."

> "I was literally dancing during glute bridges, so if that doesn't tell you how good the music was, I don't know what will."

**Rating:** 4.8 (500+ reviews)

### Impact Group Fitness

Tucked into the Jersey City fitness scene, Impact Group Fitness has built a devoted following around beat-based sculpt and interval classes. Members describe it as their "favorite class in the JC/Hoboken area" and consistently point to the playlists and instructors' energy as the reason they keep booking. The classes here fuse sculpt movements with music-driven pacing, creating combos that feel unique and never copy-pasted from another studio. It's the kind of place where the whole staff remembers your name, and the soundtrack makes every rep feel intentional.

> "Highly recommend giving it a try if you enjoy beat-based workouts, good playlists, and an amazing instructor."

> "The playlist was hitting, she made the workout fun, and she made sure she pushed us all the way through."

**Rating:** 5.0 (235 reviews)

## Turn it up

The best classes don't just work your body -- they move something deeper, and music is almost always the reason.
