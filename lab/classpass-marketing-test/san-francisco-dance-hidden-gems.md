# Hidden gems: unique dance studios in San Francisco

The Bay Area's dance scene runs deeper than the big-name studios. Across the region, smaller spaces are earning perfect ratings from every single member — studios where the teaching is exceptional, the community is tight, and the classes feel like discoveries rather than workouts. Whether you're into ballet, hip hop, aerial silks, or Zumba under the open sky, these are the spots the ClassPass community quietly adores.

## Blackbox Studios

Blackbox Studios in Oakland has become a beloved home for dancers of all levels, from serious practitioners brushing up on technique to curious beginners taking their first ballet class. The studio's warmth and artistic integrity shine through in every review, with members praising the instructors' ability to be both technically demanding and genuinely supportive.

> "As someone with fourteen years of ballet training who hasn't kept up for about eight years, this class was exactly what I was looking for. It's not an extremely beginner adult class, which has been hard to find. Definitely coming back."

> "It's clear the instructor is having fun — and she shares her creative thoughts as she teaches. I come to this class to feel beautiful as well as get a great workout with strength, cardio, and artistic expression."
