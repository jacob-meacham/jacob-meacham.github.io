In some sense, telling stories is what makes us human. This is the unique way in which we interact with our fellow humans and embed ourselves in a particular social lattice. Stories serve a number of purposes: a way of strengthening bonds, making sense of the world around us, and imparting lessons or warnings. I think nearly everyone can think of a story that has deeply affected the way they move through life

[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy) is a form of psychotherapy that focuses on the connection between our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. It is based on the premise that our thoughts influence our emotions and actions, and so by changing our thoughts, we can improve our well-being.

In CBT, a therapist helps the individual become consciously aware of their thoughts and beliefs, particularly those that may contribute to distress or problematic behaviors. By challenging and replacing irrational or negative thoughts with more realistic ones, CBT aims to alleviate psychological symptoms.

For example, if you have high anxiety in social situations, your therapist might help you become aware that your anxiety is driven by the thought that "Everyone at this party hates me." By challenging that thought - "If everyone hated me, why would I have been invited?" - you cna reduce your anxiety.

Meta-analyses have generally found that CBT is as effective as medication for treating a huge range of psychiatric issues.

CBT relies exclusively on the key insight that humans are storytellers, and the most important stories we tell are the ones we tell about ourselves to ourselves! These stories are powerful enough that differences in them have the ability to cause or cure depression or anxiety.

* I find this to be true in our work life as well.
* The narrative you have about why you are where you are
* What does it mean to be an engineer at X?
* What does it mean for me to be here?
* You can put stories to work in either a positive or negative way - CBT for an organization
 
# Mythology

As a team grows in size and in age, you have the opportunity to build our cultural mythology. Stories fade into myths and then legends as the people who were there leave.

## Mythology session
* Conduct mythology brainstorm. What are the myths in your company's past?
