You're about to leave ClassPass - sad but exciting it's true.<br>
But you're not out of here yet, you've got something to do!<br><br>

I've asked friends and colleagues to help with my plan<br>
and I've got plenty of facts about you well in hand.<br><br>

Each answer's one word, and one you should know,<br>
we'll be here to watch, just enjoying the show.<br><br>

So there's a path here to follow, and you know what to do:<br>
tell us how you joined up for the very next clue.<br>

<input id="guess" name="guess" />
<input type="button" value="How did I join?" onclick="window.open('/puzzle/javier/' + document.getElementById('guess').value)" />
</div>
