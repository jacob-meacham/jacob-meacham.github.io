You've been here a long time - an eon or more<br>
At least in years measured by ClassPass for sure<br><br>

Now you know the drill, and what is in store<br>
Embarrasing old photos and trivia galore.<br><br>

Each answer's one word, and one you should know,<br>
we'll be here to watch, just enjoying the show.<br><br>

So there's a path here to follow, and you know toward what:<br>
for whom did you commission a gallant portrait?<br>

<input id="guess" name="guess" />
<input type="button" value="Who was the portrai of?" onclick="window.open('/puzzle/karen/' + document.getElementById('guess').value)" />

You're about to leave ClassPass - sad but exciting it's true.<br>
But you're not out of here yet, you've got something to do!

I've asked friends and colleagues to help with my plan<br>
and I've got plenty of facts about you well in hand.

Each answer's one word, and one you should know,<br>
we'll be here to watch, just enjoying the show.

So there's a path here to follow, and you know what to do:<br>
tell us who's birthday you share for the very next clue.

<input id="guess" name="guess" />
<input type="button" value="Who Am I?" onclick="window.open('/puzzle/karen/' + document.getElementById('guess').value)" />
